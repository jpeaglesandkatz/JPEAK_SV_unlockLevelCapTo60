**Raises the Max Level Cap in the game to 60** (or configure it to another value)

Or if you want to go mad... Set it yourself in the .cfg file or press F1 if you have the Bepinex configuration manager installed.

The perk you receive when you hit level 50 will still be given at level 50 no matter what you set the max level cap at.

**Always backup your savegames before using any mod**

**NOTE: YOU NEED THE 32-BIT/X86 VERSION OF BEPINEX FOR STAR VALOR, NOT THE 64-BIT**
